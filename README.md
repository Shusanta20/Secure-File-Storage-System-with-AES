# 🔒 Enterprise Secure File Storage System (AES-256-GCM Encryption)

A Python-based secure file storage system that uses **AES-256-GCM encryption** to protect sensitive data.  
It provides a simple **Tkinter GUI** for file encryption/decryption, verifies file integrity using **SHA-256 hashing**,  
and logs all operations securely in an **SQLite database**.
